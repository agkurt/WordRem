WordRem: Learn Words, Enrich with Cards

WordRem is a user-friendly application designed to make language learning more effective. You can create your own customized card holders and manage different contents on each card. For example, you can create an English card holder and show the word on the front of each card and its meaning and example sentence on the back.

Features:

Card Creation and Management: Create decks and add, edit or delete cards specific to each.
Double-Faced Cards: By turning the cards, you can see both the word and its meaning.
Firebase Connection: Securely store and sync your data.
Login Screen: User-friendly login screen that allows users to save their work.
While WordRem customizes your language learning experience and makes it more effective, it also attracts attention with its ease of use. Designed to guide you on your own language learning journey.
